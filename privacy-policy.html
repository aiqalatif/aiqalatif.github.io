    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    

    <p>Welcome to PowerTracker, a mobile application developed by SkyByte . This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our app. By using our app, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>At PowerTracker, we do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users. We do not track or gather any personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email address, or any other data that could be used to identify you.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use any personal data for any purpose. Our app functions without the need for storing or processing user data, ensuring your privacy is fully maintained.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not integrate with any third-party services, and as a result, we do not share any data with external parties. Our app operates solely on the device without sending any data over the internet unless explicitly stated.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>While we do not collect personal information, we still take the security of our users' data seriously. We do not store any personal data, but we ensure that any information that may be temporarily stored or processed within the app is encrypted and protected using standard security practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not target children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such data as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
